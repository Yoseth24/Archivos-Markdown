## Project Overview

Welcome to Green Wizards Math Reasoning Step-by-Step! This project aims to enhance advanced models by developing and evaluating complex user prompts. For each pair of skills, generate prompts that integrate the skills in a sophisticated way. Prompts should be challenging enough that [latest models] are unlikely to produce accurate responses. Model outputs will be annotated to identify and correct errors.

### Key Terminology:

- **Prompt**: A question or statement designed to elicit a response from the model, incorporating two complex skills.
-   **Model Response**: The model’s step-by-step answer to the prompt, used for evaluation.
-   **Annotation**: The process of reviewing the model’s response for accuracy, relevance to the prompt, and proper skill use, while noting any reasoning errors.
-   **Error Identification**: Detecting reasoning flaws or gaps in the model’s application of skills.
-   **Error Correction**: Fixing identified errors and providing clear explanations for the corrections.
-   **Teaching Material**: If necessary, developing educational resources to explain and address reasoning errors.
